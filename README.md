### Example of lab-plaform-eks pipeline using GitHub Actions
_See lab-platform-eks README for cluster configuration details_  

Dependencies and assumptions:  

* uses existing lab identities and credentials
* deploys _gha-sandbox_ cluster to _sandbox vpc_  
* deploys _gha-preview_ cluster to _preview vpc_
* clusters are ephemeral and not configured for ingress 

Manual configurations currently required by example:  

* SECRETHUB_CREDENTIAL added to repository secrets  
* _gha-sandbox_ and _gha-preview_ environments created
  * configured to require review
  * configured for _main_ branch only
